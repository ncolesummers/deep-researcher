# Deep Research Assistant: Product Requirements Document

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

The Deep Research Assistant (DRA) is an advanced AI-powered tool designed to conduct thorough research in response to user queries. Unlike traditional search engines that return a list of links, DRA actively searches for information, analyzes sources, synthesizes findings, and presents well-cited, coherent answers in a conversational format.

### 1.2 Product Vision

To create a conversational AI assistant that performs comprehensive research on any topic, delivering factual, well-cited, and coherent answers while maintaining context across multiple conversation turns. The system will pull information from diverse, authoritative sources and present synthesized findings that directly address user queries.

### 1.3 Target Users

- Researchers seeking efficient information gathering
- Students working on academic assignments
- Knowledge workers needing factual information with citations
- Journalists researching for articles
- General users seeking in-depth information on any topic

### 1.4 Core Value Proposition

DRA drastically reduces the time and effort needed to conduct comprehensive research by:
- Automatically searching and analyzing multiple sources
- Ensuring factual accuracy with proper citations
- Maintaining conversation context to support follow-up questions
- Delivering clear, synthesized answers rather than a list of links
- Balancing different perspectives on complex topics

### 2.2 Core Components and Relationships

#### 2.2.1 User Interface / API
Accepts the user's query in natural language and displays the assistant's response. Supports conversation history viewing and follow-up questions.

#### 2.2.2 Query Processor (Interpreter)
Interprets the user's question, potentially reformulating or breaking it into sub-queries for better search coverage. Uses LLM to understand complex queries, especially multi-part or ambiguous ones.

#### 2.2.3 Search Module
Handles web searches using Tavily's Search API as the primary tool, optimized for LLM agents. May incorporate alternative search services as fallbacks or for specialized domains.

#### 2.2.4 Document Retriever & Analyzer
Fetches content from search results (web pages or documents) and analyzes them. This includes scraping text, summarizing content, and extracting key facts from each source.

#### 2.2.5 LLM Reasoner (Answer Synthesizer)
Core AI (using LangChain/LangGraph with an LLM) that takes the processed query and relevant source information to generate a synthesized answer. Produces output with citations to avoid hallucinations.

#### 2.2.6 Memory/Storage
Maintains state including conversation history, previously found sources, and intermediate results. Uses Deno KV or SQLite for persistence.

#### 2.2.7 Orchestration Manager
Coordinates the flow between components. This LangChain agent or LangGraph workflow decides when to search, when to read from memory, and when to invoke the LLM.

### 4.2 Critical Technical Decisions

#### 4.2.1 LangChain vs. Custom Orchestration
**Decision Point:** Whether to rely on LangChain/LangGraph for orchestration or build custom logic.

**Recommendation:**
Use a hybrid approach:
- LangChain for straightforward sequences (search → summarize → answer)
- LangGraph for complex flows (planning, parallel execution, etc.)
- Custom TypeScript logic for specific needs (caching, fallbacks)

**Rationale:**
- LangChain provides ready-made tools and abstractions
- LangGraph excels at managing complex agent workflows
- Custom code offers more control for bespoke requirements

#### 4.2.2 Choice of LLM and Token Management
**Decision Point:** Which LLM to use and how to manage context limitations.

**Recommendation:**
- Primary: OpenAI's GPT-4 for critical tasks (final answer synthesis)
- Secondary: GPT-3.5 for intermediate tasks (summarization, query refinement)
- Fallback: Consider open models for cost optimization
- Context Management: Split large context into multiple LLM calls if needed

**Rationale:**
- GPT-4 provides highest accuracy but at higher cost
- GPT-3.5 balances speed and cost for less critical tasks
- Multiple calls can overcome context limitations
- Strategic token usage controls costs

#### 4.2.3 Retrieval Latency Management
**Decision Point:** How to balance thoroughness vs. speed in research.

**Recommendation:**
- Cap result count (5-7 sources for most queries)
- Implement concurrent fetching for parallel processing
- Set timeouts for overall research process (15 seconds target)
- Consider preliminary/streaming answers for long queries

**Rationale:**
- Users expect responses within reasonable time (under 15 seconds)
- Parallelization reduces wait time
- Preliminary answers maintain engagement during longer searches
- User experience degrades significantly with longer waits

#### 4.2.4 Citation Accuracy Approach
**Decision Point:** How to ensure citations actually support claims.

**Recommendation:**
- Instruct LLM to include short quotes in citations
- Implement source-claim verification for critical applications
- Use structured output formats to enforce citation inclusion
- Set low LLM temperature to reduce creativity

**Rationale:**
- Quotes provide direct evidence from sources
- Verification catches misattributed claims
- Structured output ensures consistent formatting
- Lower temperature reduces hallucination risk

#### 4.2.5 Hallucination Prevention Methods
**Decision Point:** Strategies to minimize hallucinations.

**Recommendation:**
- Strict reliance on retrieved content only
- Low temperature setting for LLMs
- Explicit instructions against unsourced claims
- Optional verification step for critical applications

**Rationale:**
- Retrieval-augmentation is primary defense
- Low temperature reduces creativity/invention
- Clear instructions guide model behavior
- Verification provides additional safeguard

#### 4.2.6 Long Session Management
**Decision Point:** How to handle conversation history without exceeding context limits.

**Recommendation:**
- Implement rolling summarization of conversation
- Summarize every 5-7 turns to compress history
- Prioritize recent turns over older ones
- Store full history but use compressed context

**Rationale:**
- Summarization balances context preservation and token efficiency
- Recent history is typically more relevant
- Complete history remains available if needed
- Prevents context window overflow

#### 4.2.7 Schema Validation with Zod
**Decision Point:** When and how to use Zod for validation.

**Recommendation:**
- Use Zod for all external API responses
- Apply it to LLM structured outputs
- Implement retry logic for validation failures
- Set maximum retry attempts (3) before fallback

**Rationale:**
- Validation catches format errors early
- Retries can resolve temporary issues
- Fallbacks prevent infinite loops
- Improves overall system robustness

### 4.3 Potential Challenges and Solutions

#### 4.3.1 Hallucinations and Misinformation
**Challenge:** LLM might generate information not supported by sources.

**Solutions:**
- Strict retrieval augmentation (never answer without sources)
- Verification steps for each generated claim
- Track hallucination rate as a key metric
- Focus generation on only facts from sources

#### 4.3.2 Ambiguous or Broad Queries
**Challenge:** Users may ask extremely broad questions that are difficult to scope.

**Solutions:**
- Implement clarification mechanism for overly broad queries
- Set reasonable limits on research depth (3-5 subquestions)
- Provide high-level summaries with offers to explore subtopics
- Guide users toward more specific questions

#### 4.3.3 Managing Depth vs. Speed
**Challenge:** Trade-off between thorough research and quick responses.

**Solutions:**
- Implement adaptive depth based on query complexity

- Use cheaper models for intermediate steps
- Implement caching for common queries
- Monitor and optimize token usage

#### 4.3.6 Multi-language Support
