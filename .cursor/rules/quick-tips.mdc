# Coding Workflow Preference

- Focus on the areas of code relevant to the task
- Do not touch code unrelated to the task at hand
- Write thorough tests for all major functionality
- Avoid making major changes to the patterns and architecture of how a feature works, after it has shown to work well, unless explicitly instructed
- Always think about what other methods and areas of code might be affected by code changes
